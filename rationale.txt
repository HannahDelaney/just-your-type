For my individual type assignment, I decided to use a quote from Calvin and Hobbes, my favourite comic series. The quote is spoken by Calvin to Hobbes, as they reflect on a summer's day well spent, running about outside getting grass stains on their knees.

The typefaces I chose, Chelsea Market and Gaegu, were ones I thought were bold and easy to read, but also emulated a childlike spirit. They are sans-serif fonts that look as though they could have been handwritten by a child. The type scale was meant to emphasize and add inflection to Calvin's speech, as well as certain words like green. The final phrase is the largest on the scale, to space the words in an aesthetically pleasing way and add emphasis to the punchline of the comic panel.

I wanted to use the colour green for obvious reasons, and wished to have parts of the text appear gradually as the screen size increased. I wound up putting the words aren't, green and by, into their own grid units so that I could use the list-group-inline class and keep the spacing I wanted, and used the Typogrifier to make the other text consistent with the spacing this created. Then the Modulifier allowed me to hide elements until the screen size I wanted them to appear on. I had some trouble with this while constructing the site, because I hadn't selected all of the default options from the Modulifier site initially. I was trying to not use unnecessary css but learned that selecting everything is actually the best practice. Interestingly, I originally also had unnecessary css in my main file, but Markbot reminded me that some of these elements that I am accustomed to adding (most of the css boiler plate snippets) are not required because the other css files have them included automatically.
